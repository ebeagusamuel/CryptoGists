# CryptoGist
###  An online platform where cryptocurrency enthusiasts come to share gists about things happening in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

> This project was built as my capstone for the ROR curriculum of the Microverse software development school. It is a fullstack project built using the rails framework. Basically a user can sign up on the platform, and post gists which other users can comment on. Users can also follow and unfollow other users.

#### Active Storage Setup - Optional
AWS S3 buckets was used for active storage in production, while in development local disk was used for active storage. Follow this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@iachieve80/rails-6-0-upload-images-using-active-storage-and-amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3-36861c03dc4a) to learn how to set up AWS S3 for active storage.

### Running tests

```Ruby
    bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```
(Note that to run the test, you will need to have chrome browser installed on your computer)

### Deployment
The project was depolyed to heroku. If you set up AWS S3 for active storage and want to deploy your own copy to heroku, then you will need to allow heroku access the encrypted API keys by running

```Ruby
    heroku config:set RAILS_MASTER_KEY= <master.key>
```

(The master key can be found in the `/config/master.key` file)
